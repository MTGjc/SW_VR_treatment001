                <div id="expandableContent1" class="collapsed">
                    <p>Chun is a seasoned performer, renowned for his role as Liu Mengmei in the classic
                        Chinese opera The Peony Pavilion. He has played this role for many years, but during
                        a crucial performance, as he prepares to deliver the famous “Liu Mengmei digs up Du
                        Liniang’s grave” scene, something goes terribly wrong. His lines suddenly vanish
                        from his mind, and the stage lights feel harsh and overwhelming. He freezes, unable
                        to go on. The audience is confused, and the performance is abruptly halted.
                        <br><br>Backstage, Chun sits before the dressing room mirror, his face pale and anxious. He is
                        losing something far more important than just his lines—he is losing his memory of
                        Dong, the woman he loved. Her face, once so vivid in his mind, now fades like an old
                        photograph. He struggles to hold onto her image, but it slips further away with each
                        passing moment.
                        <br><br>Chun recalls the bet he made with Dong on their last night together: if she ever
                        disappeared, but Chun could still remember her, their love would transcend time and
                        death. But if he forgot her, their love would be lost forever. Now, Chun feels the
                    weight of that bet—he is losing, and with it, the very essence of his connection to
                        Dong.

            <button class="toggleButton" id="toggleButton2">Act 2 |  Flashbacks of Life and the Blurred Lines of Memory </button>
                <div id="expandableContent2" class="collapsed">
                    <p>The city lights illuminate the futuristic streets as Dong and Chun walk side by side.
                        After Dong finishes work, they head toward their favorite hotpot restaurant. The neon
                        signs and automated cars add a sleek, cold feel to the city, but between them, the
                        warmth is palpable. They chat about their day, with Dong teasing Chun about his
                        performances. Steam rises from the hotpot as they laugh and share stories, the heat of
                        the meal reflecting the closeness of their bond.
                        <br><br>Later, they stroll through snowy streets, the high-tech cityscape blending with the
                        gentle snowfall, creating a surreal atmosphere. It feels perfect. But suddenly, in a
                        jarring shift, Chun is alone in an empty, cold apartment. The memories of that evening,
                        of their life together, are now nothing but fleeting images, flashes of a life that once
                        was. Dong is gone, and only the shadows of their shared moments remain.
                        <br><br>Desperate to reclaim what he has lost, Chun turns to a futuristic virtual reality
                        memory restoration system. With the help of Guyu, a virtual guide, Chun repeatedly
                        rehearses scenes from The Peony Pavilion to recover his lost memories. As he works
                        through the sessions, the line between reality and the opera becomes increasingly
                        blurred.
                        <br><br>At home, Chun stares at a painting of a woman, convinced it’s Dong. But Guyu insists,
                        “This isn’t Dong. It’s Du Liniang from The Peony Pavilion.” The once-clear
                        distinctions between Dong and the opera’s tragic heroine Du Liniang begin to merge
                        in Chun’s mind. Each time he tries to remember Dong, it is Du Liniang waiting in the
                        grave that he envisions. Reality and fiction entwine, and Chun becomes unsure
                        whether he is mourning his lost love or chasing the ghost of a character from a play.

                <div id="expandableContent3" class="collapsed">
                <p>Dong has passed away, her soul drifting through the desolate void—an endless realm
                    where lost souls and broken memories linger. Here, time holds no meaning. Souls
                    wander aimlessly, searching for the elusive “Gate of Rebirth,” the only way out. No
                    one knows when or where it will appear.
                    <br><br>Dong stands beneath an ancient plum tree, where Du Liniang’s grave lies. The sight of
                    the blossoms falling gently to the ground brings her a sense of quiet that contrasts
                    with her past. She feels herself merging with the tree, almost becoming one with it as
                    she waits for Chun to come for her, like Liu Mengmei did for Du Liniang.
                    <br><br>The other souls urge her to join them in their search for the Gate, but Dong hesitates.
                    She still clings to the hope that Chun will remember her. She hopes his
                    memories—though shattered—will eventually guide him back to her, just as Liu
                    Mengmei found Du Liniang. But as time passes, she senses herself fading, becoming
                    just a fragment of Chun’s forgotten past. The other souls tell her that only those whose
                    names are remembered can leave the void. This realization weighs heavily on her.
                    Dong knows Chun’s memories of her are slipping away, just like the petals falling
                    from the plum tree.
                    <br><br>Suddenly, a massive door materializes in the distance. Souls rush towards it in a
                    frenzy. One of them grabs Dong’s hand, urging her to follow. She pauses, her eyes
                    flickering between the gate and the plum tree. But instead of running towards the gate,
                    she lets go. She remains beneath the tree, still hoping that Chun’s memory will reach
                    her, that their connection hasn’t completely faded.
                    <br><br>As the last plum blossom falls, she experiences a moment of clarity. True love, she
                    realizes, isn’t about being remembered or even being reborn—it’s about that fleeting
                    but profound connection that transcends time.

            <button class="toggleButton" id="toggleButton4">Act 4 |  Chun’s CompleteAmnesia </button>
                <div id="expandableContent4" class="collapsed">
                <p> As the performance date looms closer, Chun becomes increasingly dependent on
                    virtual reality to rehearse and recover his memories. Guyu guides him through
                    multiple scenes, especially the “lovers’ tryst” between Liu Mengmei and Du Liniang.
                    But with each session, Chun’s grip on reality weakens. His memory of Dong has been
                    entirely replaced by the figure of Du Liniang, and scenes from the opera begin to
                    invade his real life.
                    <br><br>Chun finds himself repeating gestures from the opera even outside of rehearsals. He
                    has forgotten the woman he once loved. Every time he tries to think of Dong, it is Du
                    Liniang who comes to mind. Even when he takes off the virtual reality glasses, the
                    lines between his own life and the opera blur. Chun is caught in a perpetual loop,
                    where Du Liniang is his only reality.
                    <br><br>One night, Chun dreams of the opera’s most famous scene. He sees himself in the
                    room where Liu Mengmei and Du Liniang consummated their love. In the dream, Du
                    Liniang whispers in his ear, “Do not be afraid. I am Du Liniang, and I have been
                    waiting for you…” When Chun wakes up, the last traces of Dong’s name and face
                    have vanished from his memory.All that remains is Du Liniang.

                <p> The climactic moment of The Peony Pavilion is unfolding on stage. Chun, dressed as
                    Liu Mengmei, is about to perform the iconic scene—digging up Du Liniang’s grave to
                    bring her back to life. But as he raises the tool, he freezes. His eyes widen, as if he’s
                    glimpsed something beyond the world of the stage.
                    <br><br>He drops the prop and rushes offstage, overcome with a sense of urgency. He
                    frantically searches backstage, looking for a real tool to dig, convinced that if he can
                    unearth her grave, he can bring her back. His mind is unraveling as the boundaries
                    between his role as Liu Mengmei and his real self blur.
                   <br><br>At the same time, in the distant void, Dong stands beneath the plum tree. The last
                    blossom falls, and she watches it drift to the ground. Each petal feels like a piece of
                    her memory, slipping away. She recalls the souls’ warning—only those whose names
                    are remembered can escape the void. A faint flicker of hope lights up in her eyes, as if
                    some deep connection between her and Chun is still intact.
                    <br><br>Backstage, Chun’s frantic search intensifies. He is drenched in sweat, his breathing
                    labored. He can no longer tell if he is Chun or Liu Mengmei, nor whether he is trying
                    to save Du Liniang or Dong. The line between reality and illusion has completely
                    disappeared.
                    <br><br>Suddenly, Chun stops. The tool slips from his trembling hands as he stands frozen,
                    staring into the distance. For a fleeting moment, he feels something—an undeniable,
                    distant connection to Dong. He isn’t sure if it’s real or just another illusion, but for
                    that brief second, he senses her presence.
                    <br><br>The stage lights begin to dim as time seems to freeze. Dong remains beneath the plum
                    tree, a soft, knowing smile on her face as she waits.
                    <br><br>This gamble between Chun and Dong has no clear winner. Their fates, intertwined as
                    they are, gradually dissolve over time. The boundaries between reality and illusion
                    have completely blurred. Who has won? Who has lost? In the end, the answer remains
                    unresolved.
