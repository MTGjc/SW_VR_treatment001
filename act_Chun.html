            <button class="toggleButton" id="toggleButton1">Act 1 | The Forgotten Lines and the Memory Bet </button>
            <div id="expandableContent1" class="collapsed">
                <p>Chun is a seasoned performer, renowned for his role as Liu Mengmei in the classic
                    Chinese opera The Peony Pavilion. He has played this role for many years, but during
                    a crucial performance, as he prepares to deliver the famous “Liu Mengmei digs up Du
                    Liniang’s grave” scene, something goes terribly wrong. His lines suddenly vanish
                    from his mind, and the stage lights feel harsh and overwhelming. He freezes, unable
                    to go on. The audience is confused, and the performance is abruptly halted.
                    <br><br>Backstage, Chun sits before the dressing room mirror, his face pale and anxious. He is
                    losing something far more important than just his lines—he is losing his memory of
                    Dong, the woman he loved. Her face, once so vivid in his mind, now fades like an old
                    photograph. 
                    <br><br>
                    He struggles to hold onto her image, but it slips further away with each passing moment...

                    <br><br>Chun recalls the bet he made with Dong on their last night together: 

                    <br><br>if she ever disappeared, Chun would still remember her, as their love 
                    would transcend time and death. 
                    <br><br>

                    But if he forgot her, their love would be lost forever. Now, Chun feels the
                weight of that bet—he is losing, and with it, the very essence of his connection to
                    Dong.

            <button class="toggleButton" id="toggleButton1">Act 2 | Flashbacks of Life and the Blurred Lines of Realites </button>
                <!-- <div id="expandableContent1" class="collapsed"> -->
                    <p>The city lights illuminate the futuristic streets as Dong and Chun walk side by side.
                        After Dong finishes work, they head toward their favorite hotpot restaurant. The neon
                        signs and automated cars add a sleek, cold feel to the city, but between them, the
                        warmth is palpable. They chat about their day, with Dong teasing Chun about his
                        performances. Steam rises from the hotpot as they laugh and share stories, the heat of
                        the meal reflecting the closeness of their bond.
                        <br><br>Later, they stroll through snowy streets, the high-tech cityscape blending with the
                        gentle snowfall, creating a surreal atmosphere. It feels perfect. But suddenly, in a
                        jarring shift, Chun is alone in an empty, cold apartment. The memories of that evening,
                        of their life together, are now nothing but fleeting images, flashes of a life that once
                        was. Dong is gone, and only the shadows of their shared moments remain.
                    </p>
            
            <button class="toggleButton" id="toggleButton1">Act 3 | Shattered Memories like Ghost in the Pavilion</button>
                <p> Desperate to reclaim what he has lost, Chun turns to a futuristic virtual reality
                    memory restoration system. With the help of Guyu, a virtual guide, Chun repeatedly
                        immerses himself in scenes from The Peony Pavilion, hoping the opera will unlock
                        his forgotten past. But with each session, the line between the opera and his
                        own life grows increasingly blurred, dragging him deeper into confusion.
                    <br><br>
                    At home, Chun gazes at a painting of a woman. He’s convinced it’s Dong, her face just
                        as he remembers it—soft, sorrowful, full of longing. But as his fingers trace the 
                        image, Guyu’s voice breaks through his thoughts: “This isn’t Dong. This is 
                        Du Liniang from The Peony Pavilion.” The words send a chill through Chun,
                        but he cannot shake the certainty in his heart that the woman in the painting is Dong.
                    <br><br>“No, this is her,” he protests, his voice trembling with frustration. 
                    “I know this is Dong.” But Guyu, with calm patience, repeats, “This is Du Liniang, 
                    the woman from the play. Your mind is confusing the two.”
                    As Chun stares at the painting, the woman’s face seems to shift. One moment, 
                    it’s Dong—alive, vibrant, and full of memories they shared. The next, it is 
                    Du Liniang—trapped, waiting by her grave in the opera, her beauty tinged with tragedy. 
                    The faces begin to blend, as if the woman in the painting is neither fully one 
                    nor the other but a fusion of both.
                    <br><br>
                </p>
            
            <button class="toggleButton" id="toggleButton1">Act 4 | Chun’s Complete Amnesia</button>
                <p> As the performance date looms closer, Chun becomes increasingly dependent on
                    virtual reality to rehearse and recover his memories. Guyu guides him through
                    multiple scenes, especially the “lovers’ tryst” between Liu Mengmei and Du Liniang.
                    But with each session, Chun’s grip on reality weakens. His memory of Dong has been
                    entirely replaced by the figure of Du Liniang, and scenes from the opera begin to
                    invade his real life.
                    <br><br>Chun finds himself repeating gestures from the opera even outside of rehearsals. He
                    has forgotten the woman he once loved. Every time he tries to think of Dong, it is Du
                    Liniang who comes to mind. Even when he takes off the virtual reality glasses, the
                    lines between his own life and the opera blur. Chun is caught in a perpetual loop,
                    where Du Liniang is his only reality.
                    <br><br>One night, Chun dreams of the opera’s most famous scene. He sees himself in the
                    room where Liu Mengmei and Du Liniang consummated their love. In the dream, Du
                    Liniang whispers in his ear, “Do not be afraid. I am Du Liniang, and I have been
                    waiting for you…” When Chun wakes up, the last traces of Dong’s name and face
                    have vanished from his memory. All that remains is Du Liniang.
                </p>
            

            <button class="toggleButton" id="toggleButton1">Act 5 | Return to the Stage</button>
                <p> The climactic moment of The Peony Pavilion is unfolding on stage. Chun, dressed as
                    Liu Mengmei, is about to perform the iconic scene—digging up Du Liniang’s grave to
                    bring her back to life. But as he raises the tool, he freezes. His eyes widen, as if he’s
                    glimpsed something beyond the world of the stage.
                    <br><br>He drops the prop and rushes offstage, overcome with a sense of urgency. He
                    frantically searches backstage, looking for a real tool to dig, convinced that if he can
                    unearth her grave, he can bring her back. His mind is unraveling as the boundaries
                    between his role as Liu Mengmei and his real self blur.
                   <br><br>At the same time, in the distant void, Dong stands beneath the plum tree. 
                    <br><br>Backstage, Chun’s frantic search intensifies. He is drenched in sweat, his breathing
                    labored. He can no longer tell if he is Chun or Liu Mengmei, nor whether he is trying
                    to save Du Liniang or Dong. The line between reality and illusion has completely
                    disappeared.
                    <br><br>Suddenly, Chun stops. The tool slips from his trembling hands as he stands frozen,
                    staring into the distance. For a fleeting moment, he feels something—an undeniable,
                    distant connection to Dong. He isn’t sure if it’s real or just another illusion, but for
                    that brief second, he senses her presence.
                    <br><br>The stage lights begin to dim as time seems to freeze. Dong remains beneath the plum
                    tree, a soft, knowing smile on her face as she waits.
                    <br><br>This gamble between Chun and Dong has no clear winner. Their fates, intertwined as
                    they are, gradually dissolve over time. The boundaries between reality and illusion
                    have completely blurred. Who has won? Who has lost? In the end, the answer remains
                    unresolved.
