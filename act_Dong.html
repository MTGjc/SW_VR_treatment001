                <!-- <div id="expandableContent1" class="collapsed"> -->
                    <p>Dong’s soul drifts aimlessly in the boundless, desolate void—a realm 
                        devoid of time and space. It is a liminal space filled with lost souls
                         and fragmented memories, all searching for the mythical “Gate of Rebirth,” 
                         the only escape from the void. Yet, no one knows when or where the gate 
                         will appear.
                        <br><br>
                        As Dong wanders, she finds herself drawn to an ancient plum tree, 
                        its blossoms falling softly to the ground. Beneath the tree lies the
                         grave of Du Liniang, the tragic heroine of The Peony Pavilion. The q
                         uiet beauty of the scene stirs something within Dong, resonating wit
                         h her own fragmented memories and longing for Chun, her beloved. Like 
                         Du Liniang waiting for Liu Mengmei, she hopes Chun will come to find her
                         . Yet, her wait feels endless, and despair begins to settle in her soul.
                        <br><br>The other souls urge her to join them in their search for the Gate,
                         but Dong hesitates. She still clings to the hope that Chun will remember 
                         her. She hopes his memories—though shattered—will eventually guide him 
                         back to her, just as Liu Mengmei found Du Liniang. But as time passes, 
                         she senses herself fading, becoming just a fragment of Chun’s forgotten
                          past. The other souls tell her that only those whose names are remembe
                          red can leave the void. This realization weighs heavily on her. Dong kn
                          ows Chun’s memories of her are slipping away, just like the petals fal
                          ling from the plum tree.
                        <br><br>
                        Suddenly, a massive door materializes in the distance. Souls rush towards
                         it in a frenzy. One of them grabs Dong’s hand, urging her to follow. She 
                         pauses, her eyes flickering between the gate and the plum tree. But inste
                         ad of running towards the gate, she lets go. She remains beneath the tree
                         , still hoping that Chun’s memory will reach her, that their connection 
                         hasn’t completely faded.

                <!-- <div id="expandableContent1" class="collapsed"> -->
                    <p>While Dong is lost in thought, a figure emerges from the mist—a man with 
                        a serene and otherworldly presence. Without introduction, it becomes 
                        clear that he is Tang Xianzu, the playwright of The Peony Pavilion. 
                        His arrival changes the atmosphere, infusing the void with a sense 
                        of quiet wisdom and poetic stillness.
                        <br><br>
                        Tang stands beneath the plum tree, observing Dong and her connection 
                        to the blossoms and the grave of Du Liniang. Though he speaks no words,
                         his gaze seems to understand her inner turmoil and yearning. 
                         His silent presence begins to guide Dong’s thoughts, 
                         nudging her to reflect on her own choices and desires.
                        <br><br>
                        Dong starts to see the parallels between her situation and Du Liniang’s 
                        story. Both women are bound by love—Du Liniang for Liu Mengmei and Dong 
                        for Chun. Du Liniang’s love transcended death; she waited in the underworld 
                        for Liu Mengmei and was ultimately reunited with him through her unwavering 
                        faith and courage.
                        <br><br>Should she let go and step through the Gate of 
                        Rebirth, or should she remain steadfast in her waiting, guarding the memories 
                        she holds dear and believing that Chun will honor their bond and fulfill the
                         wager of love? Tang remains calm and gradually guides Dong through the
                        opera segment 'The Dream in Visiting the Garden'
                    </p>

            <button class="toggleButton" id="toggleButton1">Act 3 | A Moment of Clarity Beneath the Plum Tree </button>
                <!-- <div id="expandableContent1" class="collapsed"> -->
                    <p>As the plum blossoms fall around her, Dong contemplates her fate. 
                        She realizes that the Gate of Rebirth, though tempting, may not be 
                        the answer she truly seeks. Inspired by Du Liniang’s story, she 
                        reflects on the nature of love, memory, and her own longing.
                        <br><br>
                        Dong decides that she will not pursue the Gate of Rebirth. 
                        Instead, she chooses to remain beneath the plum tree, waiting 
                        for Chun. This decision is not born of desperation but of quiet 
                        strength and unwavering faith. She believes that if Chun truly loves her, 
                        he will find her, just as Liu Mengmei found Du Liniang. Even if Chun never 
                        comes, she resolves to find peace in her memories and the beauty of her 
                        surroundings.
                        <br><br>
                        Tang Xianzu’s figure fades back into the mist, leaving Dong alone beneath
                         the plum tree. His departure feels like a blessing, as though he has 
                         passed on a sense of clarity and acceptance.Dong sits beneath the tree, 
                         watching the blossoms drift through the void. Her wait is no longer 
                         tinged with fear or sorrow but filled with quiet resolve and peace.
                         <br><br>
                         As the last plum blossom falls, she experiences a moment of clarity. 
                         True love, she realizes, isn’t about being remembered or even being 
                         reborn—it’s about that fleeting but profound connection that transcends time.
                        <br><br>
                         The last blossom falls, and Dong watches it drift to the ground. 
                         Each petal feels like a piece of her memory, slipping away. 
                         She recalls the souls’ warning—only those whose names are remembered can
                          escape the void. 
                          <br><br> A faint flicker of hope suddenly 
                          appeared in her eyes, as if some deep connection between her and Chun is 
                          still intact.
