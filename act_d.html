        <h3 class="main__para-style char" id="dong_bet"> <a href="act_c.html">"if I ever disappeared, would 
            you still remember me, as love would transcend time and death?"</a></h3>

            <p class="main__para-style subpara"> Dong’s narrative unfolds in the vast valleys of Tibet, a symbolic representation of the
                void she exists in, waiting in solitude. The vastness and quiet of Tibet reflect her
                longing for Chun, while also illustrating her gradual fading from memory. The natural
                light and wide, open landscapes create a sense of extreme tranquility, as if time itself
                has come to a standstill. <br><br> <a class="main__para-style subpara_b">Aspect Ratio:</a><br>  Dong’s scenes are filmed in 2.39:1, a widescreen format. This aspect
                ratio emphasizes the expanse of nature and her smallness within it, symbolizing her
                isolation and inner peace. The soft lighting and cold tones of these scenes further
                enhance the atmosphere of waiting in the liminal space of the “no man’s land,”
                suggesting her delicate connection to nature and the vastness of time.

                <div id="expandableContent1" class="collapsed">
                    <p>Dong’s soul drifts aimlessly in the boundless, desolate void—a realm 
                        devoid of time and space. It is a liminal space filled with lost souls
                         and fragmented memories, all searching for the mythical “Gate of Rebirth,” 
                         the only escape from the void. Yet, no one knows when or where the gate 
                         will appear.
                        <br><br>
                        As Dong wanders, she finds herself drawn to an ancient plum tree, 
                        its blossoms falling softly to the ground. Beneath the tree lies the
                         grave of Du Liniang, the tragic heroine of The Peony Pavilion. The q
                         uiet beauty of the scene stirs something within Dong, resonating wit
                         h her own fragmented memories and longing for Chun, her beloved. Like 
                         Du Liniang waiting for Liu Mengmei, she hopes Chun will come to find her
                         . Yet, her wait feels endless, and despair begins to settle in her soul.
                        <br><br>The other souls urge her to join them in their search for the Gate,
                         but Dong hesitates. She still clings to the hope that Chun will remember 
                         her. She hopes his memories—though shattered—will eventually guide him 
                         back to her, just as Liu Mengmei found Du Liniang. But as time passes, 
                         she senses herself fading, becoming just a fragment of Chun’s forgotten
                          past. The other souls tell her that only those whose names are remembe
                          red can leave the void. This realization weighs heavily on her. Dong kn
                          ows Chun’s memories of her are slipping away, just like the petals fal
                          ling from the plum tree.
                        <br><br>
                        Suddenly, a massive door materializes in the distance. Souls rush towards
                         it in a frenzy. One of them grabs Dong’s hand, urging her to follow. She 
                         pauses, her eyes flickering between the gate and the plum tree. But inste
                         ad of running towards the gate, she lets go. She remains beneath the tree
                         , still hoping that Chun’s memory will reach her, that their connection 
                         hasn’t completely faded.

            <div id="expandableContent2" class="collapsed">
                <p>While Dong is lost in thought, a figure emerges from the mist—a man with 
                        a serene and otherworldly presence. Without introduction, it becomes 
                        clear that he is Tang Xianzu, the playwright of The Peony Pavilion. 
                        His arrival changes the atmosphere, infusing the void with a sense 
                        of quiet wisdom and poetic stillness.
                        <br><br>
                        Tang stands beneath the plum tree, observing Dong and her connection 
                        to the blossoms and the grave of Du Liniang. Though he speaks no words,
                         his gaze seems to understand her inner turmoil and yearning. 
                         His silent presence begins to guide Dong’s thoughts, 
                         nudging her to reflect on her own choices and desires.
                        <br><br>
                        Dong starts to see the parallels between her situation and Du Liniang’s 
                        story. Both women are bound by love—Du Liniang for Liu Mengmei and Dong 
                        for Chun. Du Liniang’s love transcended death; she waited in the underworld 
                        for Liu Mengmei and was ultimately reunited with him through her unwavering 
                        faith and courage.
                        <br><br>Should she let go and step through the Gate of 
                        Rebirth, or should she remain steadfast in her waiting, guarding the memories 
                        she holds dear and believing that Chun will honor their bond and fulfill the
                         wager of love? Tang remains calm and gradually guides Dong through the
                        opera segment 'The Dream in Visiting the Garden'</p>

                <div id="expandableContent3" class="collapsed">
                <p>As the plum blossoms fall around her, Dong contemplates her fate. 
                    She realizes that the Gate of Rebirth, though tempting, may not be 
                    the answer she truly seeks. Inspired by Du Liniang’s story, she 
                    reflects on the nature of love, memory, and her own longing.
                    <br><br>
                    Dong decides that she will not pursue the Gate of Rebirth. 
                    Instead, she chooses to remain beneath the plum tree, waiting 
                    for Chun. This decision is not born of desperation but of quiet 
                    strength and unwavering faith. She believes that if Chun truly loves her, 
                    he will find her, just as Liu Mengmei found Du Liniang. Even if Chun never 
                    comes, she resolves to find peace in her memories and the beauty of her 
                    surroundings.
                    <br><br>
                    Tang Xianzu’s figure fades back into the mist, leaving Dong alone beneath
                     the plum tree. His departure feels like a blessing, as though he has 
                     passed on a sense of clarity and acceptance.Dong sits beneath the tree, 
                     watching the blossoms drift through the void. Her wait is no longer 
                     tinged with fear or sorrow but filled with quiet resolve and peace.
                     <br><br>
                     As the last plum blossom falls, she experiences a moment of clarity. 
                     True love, she realizes, isn’t about being remembered or even being 
                     reborn—it’s about that fleeting but profound connection that transcends time.
                    <br><br>
                     The last blossom falls, and Dong watches it drift to the ground. 
                     Each petal feels like a piece of her memory, slipping away. 
                     She recalls the souls’ warning—only those whose names are remembered can
                      escape the void. 
                      <br><br> A faint flicker of hope suddenly 
                      appeared in her eyes, as if some deep connection between her and Chun is 
                      still intact.

                <div id="expandableContent4" class="collapsed">
                <p> As the performance date looms closer, Chun becomes increasingly dependent on
                    virtual reality to rehearse and recover his memories. Guyu guides him through
                    multiple scenes, especially the “lovers’ tryst” between Liu Mengmei and Du Liniang.
                    But with each session, Chun’s grip on reality weakens. His memory of Dong has been
                    entirely replaced by the figure of Du Liniang, and scenes from the opera begin to
                    invade his real life.
                    <br><br>Chun finds himself repeating gestures from the opera even outside of rehearsals. He
                    has forgotten the woman he once loved. Every time he tries to think of Dong, it is Du
                    Liniang who comes to mind. Even when he takes off the virtual reality glasses, the
                    lines between his own life and the opera blur. Chun is caught in a perpetual loop,
                    where Du Liniang is his only reality.
                    <br><br>One night, Chun dreams of the opera’s most famous scene. He sees himself in the
                    room where Liu Mengmei and Du Liniang consummated their love. In the dream, Du
                    Liniang whispers in his ear, “Do not be afraid. I am Du Liniang, and I have been
                    waiting for you…” When Chun wakes up, the last traces of Dong’s name and face
                    have vanished from his memory.All that remains is Du Liniang.
