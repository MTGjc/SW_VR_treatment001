        <h3 class="main__para-style char" id="dong_bet"> <a href="act_c.html">"if I ever disappeared, would 
            you still remember me, as love would transcend time and death?"</a></h3>

            <p class="main__para-style subpara"> Dong’s narrative unfolds in the vast valleys of Tibet, a symbolic representation of the
                void she exists in, waiting in solitude. The vastness and quiet of Tibet reflect her
                longing for Chun, while also illustrating her gradual fading from memory. The natural
                light and wide, open landscapes create a sense of extreme tranquility, as if time itself
                has come to a standstill. <br><br> <a class="main__para-style subpara_b">Aspect Ratio:</a><br>  Dong’s scenes are filmed in 2.39:1, a widescreen format. This aspect
                ratio emphasizes the expanse of nature and her smallness within it, symbolizing her
                isolation and inner peace. The soft lighting and cold tones of these scenes further
                enhance the atmosphere of waiting in the liminal space of the “no man’s land,”
                suggesting her delicate connection to nature and the vastness of time.

            <button class="toggleButton">Act 1 | The Desolate Void </button>
                <div >
                    <p class="main__para-style char">Dong’s soul drifts aimlessly in the boundless, desolate void—a realm 
                        devoid of time and space. It is a liminal space filled with lost souls
                         and fragmented memories, all searching for the mythical “Gate of Rebirth,” 
                         the only escape from the void. Yet, no one knows when or where the gate 
                         will appear.
                        <br><br>
                        As Dong wanders, she finds herself drawn to an ancient plum tree, 
                        its blossoms falling softly to the ground. Beneath the tree lies the
                         grave of Du Liniang, the tragic heroine of The Peony Pavilion. The q
                         uiet beauty of the scene stirs something within Dong, resonating wit
                         h her own fragmented memories and longing for Chun, her beloved. Like 
                         Du Liniang waiting for Liu Mengmei, she hopes Chun will come to find her
                         . Yet, her wait feels endless, and despair begins to settle in her soul.
                        <br><br><a href="" class="hyperLink">The other souls urge her to join them in their search for the Gate,
                         but Dong hesitates.</a> She still clings to the hope that Chun will remember 
                         her. She hopes his memories—though shattered—will eventually guide him 
                         back to her, just as Liu Mengmei found Du Liniang. But as time passes, 
                         she senses herself fading, becoming just a fragment of Chun’s forgotten
                          past. The other souls tell her that only those whose names are remembe
                          red can leave the void. This realization weighs heavily on her. Dong kn
                          ows Chun’s memories of her are slipping away, just like the petals fal
                          ling from the plum tree.
                        <br><br>
                        Suddenly, a massive door materializes in the distance. Souls rush towards
                         it in a frenzy. One of them grabs Dong’s hand, urging her to follow. She 
                         pauses, her eyes flickering between the gate and the plum tree. But inste
                         ad of running towards the gate, she lets go. She remains beneath the tree
                         , still hoping that Chun’s memory will reach her, that their connection 
                         hasn’t completely faded.

            <button class="toggleButton">Act 2 | The Convergence of Fate </button>
                <div class="block" ><p class="main__para-style char">The office was dimly lit, filled with the hum of machines and the soft 
                    click of keys as Dong sat at her desk. Her world was a constant rhythm
                    of code, data, and virtual setups—a perfect, predictable routine. 
                    As a technician at a high-tech VR company, her daily tasks revolved 
                    around ensuring that complex projects ran smoothly: checking language
                    packs, pre-loading databases, and fine-tuning the platform that host
                    ed virtual performances like Chun’s theater. 
                    <br><br> Dong was operating system checks among multiple projects’ content, 
                    confirming that everything was ready for the next run, when an unfamiliar 
                    snippet of sound drifted through her headphones. It was subtle at first—ju
                    st a fleeting melody, but it repeated and glitched, softly, in the background.
                    <br><br>
                    Frowning, she paused. The same line repeated again, over and over. Dong 
                    decided to quickly debug and ran a diagnostic check on the content package
                    across each project in the interface. Everything seemed fine. Eventually, 
                    she discovered that the repeating “issue” wasn’t caused by an operational 
                    bug. Instead, it appeared that someone was having difficulty rehearsing their l
                    ines. Dong leaned back in her chair, smiling slightly, growing curious about t
                    he play and the performer, Chun. Out of curiosity, she traced the IP address
                    and found it was linked to a small theater down the street. Two stranger s
                    ouls gradually draw closer in this cold, unreal city.

                <p class="main__para-style char">While Dong is lost in thought, a figure emerges from the mist—a man with 
                a serene and otherworldly presence. Without introduction, it becomes 
                clear that he is Tang Xianzu, the playwright of The Peony Pavilion. 
                His arrival changes the atmosphere, infusing the void with a sense 
                of quiet wisdom and poetic stillness.

                <a href="" class="hyperLink">Tang stands beneath the plum tree, observing Dong and her connection

                His silent presence begins to guide Dong’s thoughts, 
                nudging her to reflect on her own choices and desires.

                <p class="main__para-style char">As the plum blossoms fall around her, Dong contemplates her fate. 
                She realizes that the Gate of Rebirth, though tempting, may not be 
                the answer she truly seeks. Inspired by Du Liniang’s story, she 
                reflects on the nature of love, memory, and her own longing.
                <br><br>
                <a href="" class="hyperLink">Dong decides that she will not pursue the Gate of Rebirth. 
                Instead, she chooses to remain beneath the plum tree, waiting 
                for Chun.</a> This decision is not born of desperation but of quiet 
                strength and unwavering faith. She believes that if Chun truly loves her, 
                he will find her, just as Liu Mengmei found Du Liniang. Even if Chun never

                Tang Xianzu’s figure fades back into the mist, leaving Dong alone beneath

                passed on a sense of clarity and acceptance.Dong sits beneath the tree, 
                watching the blossoms drift through the void. Her wait is no longer 
                tinged with fear or sorrow but filled with quiet resolve and peace.

                As the last plum blossom falls, she experiences a moment of clarity. 
                True love, she realizes, isn’t about being remembered or even being 
                reborn—it’s about that fleeting but profound connection that transcends time.
                <br><br>
                The last blossom falls, and Dong watches it drift to the ground. 
                Each petal feels like a piece of her memory, slipping away. 
                She recalls the souls’ warning—only those whose names are remembered can
                escape the void. 
                <br><br> <a href="" class="hyperLink">A faint flicker of hope suddenly
