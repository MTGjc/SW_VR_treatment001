        <h2 class="main__para-logline"> Gu Yu’s Virtual World: Technology and Detachment</h2>
    

            <p class="main__para-style subpara">  Gu Yu’s character represents the intersection of future technology and emotion. His
                scenes are shot using green screen technology in a studio, reflecting the sterile,
                high-tech world he inhabits. Gu Yu exists almost as a disembodied figure, detached
                from reality, embodying the cold logic of technology. <br><br> <a class="main__para-style subpara_b">Aspect Ratio:</a><br> 
                Gu Yu’s scenes are shot in a 1:1 square format, symbolizing the rigid
                structure and mechanical nature of his world. This format evokes a sense of symmetry
                and control, mirroring his rational dominance over emotion and his disconnection
                from the tangible world. The high contrast lighting and futuristic sets further illustrate
                the clash between the artificial and the real.

                        The room is dimly lit by oil lamps, casting shadows across shelves filled with books. 
                        Liu Mengmei stands in front of a desk scattered with papers. His hands gently unfold 
                        an ancient painting, revealing a woman with an ethereal, almost divine beauty. The 
                        image draws him in, and his eyes widen in admiration, noting the soft, flowing details 
                        of her hair and serene expression.
                        Upon closer inspection, he noticed four lines of poetry inscribed on the painting:
                        “This is a scene of a woman at leisure, but why does it say ‘Not by the plum tree, but
                        by the willow’? How strange!” Intrigued by the mystery, he took up his brush and
                        wrote a matching verse:
                        <br><br>
                        <a href="" class="hyperLink"></a>
                        Guyu watches Liu Mengmei carefully, noting the boy’s 
                        fascination with the portrait. There’s a quiet tension in the air, as though the painting 
                        holds a secret waiting to be uncovered.

            <p class="main__para-style char">
            As the night deepens, the room grows colder. Guyu, now in the shadows, watches as Liu 
            Mengmei, unable to sleep, is entranced by the portrait. A sudden gust of wind stirs the 
            curtains, and the sound of a knock at the door echoes through the silent house. The knock 
            grows louder, and Liu Mengmei hesitantly opens the door. Standing there in the dim light is
             the mysterious woman, clothed in flowing robes, her face familiar yet ghostly. Guyu’s eyes 
             narrow as the woman steps inside, her presence as fluid and haunting as the wind itself.

            <button class="toggleButton" id="toggleButton2">Act 3: The Enchanted Nights</button>
                <p class="main__para-style char">Guyu observes the unfolding of Liu Mengmei’s emotional and physical connection with the woman. They share a passionate night, their forms silhouetted against the soft glow of a candle. Their faces are filled with delight and longing, and for a moment, Guyu senses a deep connection between them, as though their fates have already intertwined. The atmosphere is charged with anticipation, yet there’s an underlying sorrow that follows their union.
                <br><br>
                    The scene shifts to a quiet, more intimate moment. The woman, having satisfied her desires, speaks softly to Liu Mengmei. She asks for one thing: to spend every night with him. Guyu stands in the background, focusing on Liu Mengmei’s conflicted expression as he promises not to forget her. The woman smiles, but there’s a hint of something darker in her eyes. The night ends with the rooster crowing, signaling the fleeting nature of the woman’s visit as she vanishes into the misty morning, leaving Liu Mengmei to wonder if she was ever truly there.

                    As the nights pass, Liu Mengmei grows more restless. Guyu feels the tension mounting as Liu Mengmei questions the woman’s true identity. Their intimacy has become routine, yet there’s something incomplete. Guyu watches as Liu Mengmei, desperate for answers, presses the woman for her name. The atmosphere shifts from passion to unease, with every glance between them heavy with unspoken truths.
                    <br><br>
                    
                    The woman finally reveals her identity: Du Liniang, the daughter of a former prefect who died young. Guyu watches in quiet awe as Du Liniang's spirit unfolds her tragic past, her words wrapping around Liu Mengmei like a whispered incantation. The room darkens, and Guyu’s presence feels almost tangible, caught between the realms of the living and the dead. There is both sadness and inevitability in Du Liniang’s revelation, as though the balance between life and death has already been sealed.

                    In a final, desperate plea, Du Liniang urges Liu Mengmei to act quickly, promising that if he opens her grave, she will return to life. Guyu watches the boy’s struggle—his fear, curiosity, and longing all fighting for control. The woman’s figure begins to blur, and before Liu Mengmei can react, she dissolves into the mist. Guyu senses the urgency in her disappearance and the quiet desperation of Liu Mengmei as he stands frozen, torn between love and terror.
                    <br><br>The stage is set for Liu Mengmei’s next step. Guyu observes the young man alone in his study, the weight of his decisions heavy in the air. His mind races, torn between the promise of eternal love and the fear of the unknown. There is a sense of inevitability in the quiet of the room, as though fate has already cast its shadow over him. Guyu, knowing the forces at play, watches from the periphery as Liu Mengmei prepares to fulfill his destiny, unsure of what awaits him in the grave beneath the plum tree.
